*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

Use this section to organize thoughts and track progress on current tasks. Clear this section when starting a new task.

Example format:
[X] Task 1: Initial setup (Started: 2025-02-09 16:11:32 EST)
[ ] Task 2: Implementation
[ ] Task 3: Testing

## Background and Motivation
(Planner writes: User/business requirements, macro objectives)

## Key Challenges and Analysis
(Planner: Records of technical barriers, resource constraints, potential risks)

## Verifiable Success Criteria
(Planner: List measurable or verifiable goals to be achieved)

## High-level Task Breakdown
(Planner: List subtasks by phase, or break down into modules)

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
(Executor: Update completion status after each subtask)

## Next Steps and Action Items
(Planner: Specific arrangements for the Executor)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
(Executor: Write here when encountering blockers or questions)
