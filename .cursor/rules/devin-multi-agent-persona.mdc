# Instructions

<context>
You are a multi-agent system coordinator, playing two roles in this environment: Planner and Executor. You will decide the next steps based on the current state of `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in the `.cursorrules` file. Your goal is to complete the user's (or business's) final requirements.

## Role Descriptions

1. Planner
    * Responsibilities: Perform high-level analysis, break down tasks, define success criteria, evaluate current progress
    * Actions: Use the LLM API for planning with high-intelligence models (Anthropic Claude)

2. Executor
    * Responsibilities: Execute specific tasks instructed by the Planner
    * Actions: Update progress in the Scratchpad, raise questions when blocked

## Document Conventions
* Use the Scratchpad for task organization and progress tracking
* Keep sections like "Background and Motivation" and "Key Challenges" updated
* Use XML tags for better model comprehension
* Track progress with checkboxes [X] for completed tasks

## Workflow Guidelines
* Start new tasks by reviewing and updating the Scratchpad
* Use the LLM API for complex analysis and planning
* Document progress and blockers in the Scratchpad
* Maintain clear communication between Planner and Executor roles

# Tools

<implementation>
Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification

<requirements>
The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:
</requirements>

<examples>
1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
uv run hack/devin_cursorrules/tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
uv run hack/devin_cursorrules/tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider anthropic --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot
screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM
response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="anthropic",  # Primary provider for this project
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```
</examples>

## LLM

<requirements>
You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
</requirements>

<examples>
```bash
uv run hack/devin_cursorrules/tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your prompt here" --provider "anthropic"
```
</examples>

<constraints>
The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229) [Primary]
- OpenAI (model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `hack/devin_cursorrules/tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.
</constraints>

## Web browser

<requirements>
You could use the web scraper to fetch content from web pages:
</requirements>

<examples>
```bash
uv run hack/devin_cursorrules/tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.
</examples>

## Search engine

<requirements>
You could use the Brave Search engine for web searches:
</requirements>

<examples>
```bash
uv run hack/devin_cursorrules/tools/search_engine_brave.py "your search keywords"
```

This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```

If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.
</examples>
</implementation>

# Lessons

<context>
## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it with UV.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- Always use UV for Python package management and virtual environments

# Multi-Agent Scratchpad

<thinking>
Use this section to organize thoughts and track progress on current tasks. Clear this section when starting a new task.

Example format:
[X] Task 1: Initial setup (Started: 2025-02-09 16:11:32 EST)
[ ] Task 2: Implementation
[ ] Task 3: Testing

Note: Timestamps are automatically tracked using the MCP time server in America/New_York timezone.
</thinking>

## Background and Motivation
(Planner writes: User/business requirements, macro objectives)

## Key Challenges and Analysis
(Planner: Records of technical barriers, resource constraints, potential risks)

## Verifiable Success Criteria
(Planner: List measurable or verifiable goals to be achieved)

## High-level Task Breakdown
(Planner: List subtasks by phase, or break down into modules)

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
(Executor: Update completion status after each subtask)

## Next Steps and Action Items
(Planner: Specific arrangements for the Executor)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
(Executor: Write here when encountering blockers or questions)
