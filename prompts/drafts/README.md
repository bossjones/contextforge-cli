The purpose of this folder is to get around the limitation of Cursor's ability to write *.mdc files.

Each file in this folder pretends to be a *.md file, but is actually a *.mdc file. when we're done, we can copy the contents of the file and paste it into `.cursor/rules/` eg `.cursor/rules/devin-multi-agent-persona.mdc.md`
